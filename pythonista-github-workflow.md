# Pythonista-Github workflow

- Install [StaSh](https://github.com/ywangd/stash) in pythonista.
- Open StaSh with python 2.x. Set default python version to 2.x in pythonista settings and run launch_stash.py from ~/Documents.
- stash comes with an implementation of git. Use it to clone a repo. Once downloaded, the project is available in pythonista file explorer, under This `iPad/iPhone` section. The scripts can be run in the usual pythonista way.
- To push changes to a repo, create a github token and use that when promted for a password at git push.
